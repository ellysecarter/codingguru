## Description
This site is a timed quiz of 5 coding questions.

If you get the answer right, it moves on to the next question and confirms that you were correct. 

If you get the answer wrong, it moves on to the next question but deducts 10 seconds from your time. 

At the end of the quiz, your time left on the quiz is your score. The quicker you finish the quiz with the correct answers, the higher your score.

At the end of the quiz, you can input your initials to save your score.

You can select the button "View High Scores" to see the high scores that are saved in the local storage. 

You can select "Clear High Scores" to clear the high score list.

You can select the "Go Back" button to start the quiz from the beginning.
